I program open source using git since 2017 but have also multiple private repositories for university projects and prototypes.

- Languages: German, English
- Operating systems:
  - Linux (Manjaro on my workstation and Raspbian on my local server)
  - Windows (Only from time to time and only to check for cross platform compatibility)
- Programming languages:
  - Bash **`Good`**
    - Small/Medium scripts (often cross platform with Windows MinGW)
  - C++ [14,17,20] **`Good`** (currently learning)
    - Qt QML cross-platform desktop apps (only small ones)
    - Cross-platform interprocess data/message framework (Boost)
    - Cross-platform live image stitching (OpenCV)
    - Data Science/AI scripts (only for the basics)
    - Testing with catch2
  - CMake [3.15+] **`Good`**
    - Advanced/Simple C++ build scripts
  - HTML [5] (and CSS) **`Advanced`**
    - Advanced/Simple web sites
  - Java [8] **`Previously Advanced`** (I stopped doing Java related things which means it would take some time getting back into it and I don't know many of the new features like modules)

    - Small Discord/Telegram/... bots
    - Testing with mocha and chai
    - Many of my prototypes start in these languages
  - Make **`Good`**

  - Powershell [6,7] **`Good Beginner`**
    - Small/Medium cross-platform (but mostly native Windows 10) scripts
  - Python [2.7, 3.6, 3.8] **`Good`**
